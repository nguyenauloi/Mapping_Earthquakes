# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13

## **Project Overview**
The purpose of this project was to create a website that allows the user to view earthquake data from around in the world in an interactive format. The website uses the Leaflet library, JavaScript, and HTML to display GeoJSON files that were called through the mapbox API.

The website is able to display information about earthquakes from around the world. The filter [fig 1] on the website allows the user to toggle all earthquakes [fig 2] or major earthquakes [fig 3] (4.5 and above). Users will also be able to display the earthquakes over tectonic plates [fig 4].
